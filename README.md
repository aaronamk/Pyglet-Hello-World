# pyglet_test

This is to test that GitHub, Pyglet, and anything else needed to code for our club is working on your computer.

Clone this repo (using "git clone --recursive-submodules" to include pyglet in the installation) and run main.py. A window should open and you should be able to move your character around the screen with WASD keys.
