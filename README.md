# pyglet_test

This is a thing to test that GitHub, Pyglet, and anything else needed to coding for our club is working on your computer.

Clone and run main.py (using "git clone --recursive-submodules" to include pyglet in the installation). You should be able to move your character around the screen with WASD.
